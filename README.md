# Simple Keylogger Tool

## Overview

The Simple Keylogger Tool is a Python-based application designed to run discreetly in the background, recording keystrokes and timestamps into a specified text file.

### Features

- **Background Operation**: Runs silently in the background without user interaction.
- **Timestamps**: Records the time of each keystroke event.
- **Logging**: Logs all keystrokes and timestamps into a text file specified within the code.

### Important Note

The logs file path needs to be specified within the Python code before running the keylogger tool. To set the path, locate the relevant section in the code labeled with comments or configuration variables indicating where the log file path should be entered.

## Getting Started

To use the Simple Keylogger Tool, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
https://github.com/cookie-warrior/Simple_Keylogger_tool.git

2. **Configure the log file path**:

Open the Python script in a text editor and locate the section where the log file path is specified. Modify this path to specify where you want the logs to be saved.

Example:
log_file = '/path/to/your/log/file.txt'
